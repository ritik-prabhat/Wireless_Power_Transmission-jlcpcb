Several aspects of the world can be transformed by wireless power transfer. Wireless
From charging a handheld device to reducing energy consumption, power transfer has a solution for everything
associated with global warming. Using microwaves from space, power transfer can reduce energy consumption by 50 percent.
Microwaves from space are emerging as a viable commercial solution to the global warming issue.
Increasing electricity demand. The use of this technology will provide Earth with unlimited electricity.
It will also open up several new opportunities for space exploration. Tech companies will also benefit.
You can use WPT to expand the capabilities of most small electronic devices, such as mobile phones,
personal digital assistants, and MP3 players.
